# CS4220 Control Model (w/o CT scan)

This is a working model to predict lung function decline based on FVC values in pulmonary fibrosis patients. This idea was adapted and based on the Kaggle OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression challange. 

The current model is only able to predict 1 FVC value per patient. Only tabular datasets were used. 

The OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression Dataset was used.
